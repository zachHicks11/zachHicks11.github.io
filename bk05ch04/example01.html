                    <h2>Irate Grammarians Will See <em>You</em> in Court, Mister!</h2>
                </header>
                <p>KALAMAZOO, Michigan—A group of disgruntled grammarians calling themselves &quot;Mad, We Are, As Hell&quot; has filed a number of civil lawsuits over the past few weeks. The targets of these suits are writers, raconteurs, and professional man-in-the-street interviewees who, they claim, are inveterate violators of the rules of grammar.</p>
                
                <p>The group's spokesperson, Millicent Peevish, Head Shusher at the Kalamazoo District Library, said the grammarians could no longer sit back and allow &quot;the splitting of blameless infinitives and the ending of sentences with evil, evil prepositions.&quot; A previous campaign — called Shock and Appalled — that focused on writing testy letters to the editors of various local publications had no discernible effect.</p>
                
                <p>One defendant is the essayist and dry cleaning critic Boris Langenshortevitch, whom the grammarians describe as a &quot;monster&quot; who &quot;brazenly and redundantly uses 'the hoi polloi', when any fool with half a brain knows that 'hoi' is the old Greek word for 'the.' Duh!&quot; Edna Doright, Chief Comma Officer at Tomes ’R Us, defended the suit. &quot;Without an appreciation for ancient Greek, we as a society are lost,&quot; she said. For his part, Mr. Langenshortevitch is unrepentant. &quot;I won't change the way I write but, to be quite honest, these grammar fundamentalists scare the crap out of me,&quot; he said.</p>
                
                <p>When asked if litigation was the appropriate response to these alleged grammar violations, Harvey Earnest, president of the Center for Subject-Verb Agreement, was adamant. &quot;My God,&quot; he said, &quot;there are people out there wantonly dangling participles and starting sentences with conjunctions. Where will all this madness lead us if we do not do something to stop it?&quot;</p>
