            We have a deep-rooted delight in the comic effect of words in English, and not just in advertising jingles but at the highest level of endeavor. <br>—BILL BRYSON, <i>The Mother Tongue</i>, 1990
            </p><p>
            Jubilance is an explanation for a lot of the things that happen in language. <br>—ALLEN WALKER READ, quoted in "At Play in the Language," by Michelle Stacy, <i>The New Yorker</i>, September 4, 1989
            </p><p>
            The deep and unconscious delight in language is one of the marks of difference between advantage and deprivation; the deprived child is deprived of joy. <br>—ANDREW WILKINSON, <i>The Foundations of Language</i>, 1971
            </p><p>
            Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very conscious and inventive in their use of language. <br>—ERIC RAYMOND, <i>The New Hackers Dictionary</i>, 1991
            </p><p>
            Everyone plays with language or responds to language play. Some take mild pleasure from it; others are totally obsessed by it; but no one can avoid it. <br>—DAVID CRYSTAL, <i>Language Play</i>, 1998
            </p><p>
            Comedy: The least controllable use of language and therefore the most threatening to people in power. <br>—JOHN RALSTON SAUL, <i>The Doubter’s Companion</i>, 1994
            </p><p>
            There’s a helluva distance between wisecracking and wit. Wit has truth in it; wisecracking is simply calisthenics with words. <br>—DOROTHY PARKER, “Interview,” <i>Writers at Work</i>, 1958
            </p><p>
            Blows are sarcasms turned stupid: wit is a form of force that leaves the limbs at rest. <br>—GEORGE ELIOT, <i>Felix Holt, The Radical</i>, 1866
            </p><p>
            Those who talk on the razor-edge of double-meanings pluck the rarest blooms from the precipice on either side. <br>—LOGAN PEARSALL SMITH, <i>Afterthoughts</i>, 1931
            </p><p>
            Wit is educated insolence. <br>—ARISTOTLE, <i>The Art of Rhetoric</i>, 4th century B.C.
            </p><p>
            Jokes are grievances. <br>—MARSHALL MCLUHAN, “Speech to the American Booksellers Association,” June 7, 1969
            </p><p>
            Impropriety is the soul of wit. <br>—W. SOMERSET MAUGHAM, <i>The Moon and Sixpence</i>, 1919
            </p><p>
            Finding the inappropriate word — the device upon which irony depends. <br>—JOHN CAREY, <i>The Violent Effigy</i>, 1973
            </p><p>
            We should begin by looking. And the place to begin is not in the stolid center but at the vibrant edges of language — among the bilingual, the flouters of convention, the daring, the young — not at the middle of the road, where all the traffic flows, but on the verge, where boundaries form and shift. <br>—RICHARD W. BAILEY, “Language at the Edges,” <i>American Speech 75.4</i>, Winter 2000
            </p><p>
            I would say that the dislike, the fear sometimes, of wordplay tells us a good deal, as do attitudes towards the human body, about puritanism. Of such sniffers at words, such misologists, we might say that their imaginations are nasty, British, and short. <br>—WALTER REDFERN, <i>Puns</i>, 1984
            </p><p>
            A difference of taste in jokes is a great strain on the affections. <br>—GEORGE ELIOT, <i>Daniel Deronda</i>, 1876
